# How to run
clone the repo to pull down the code.

### configure .env
`go get github.com/joho/godotenv` so we can use a .env file
then set the vars
`CHANNEL_ID=UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw` replace with your channel ID at some point. This is the googleDev channelID which can be used for initial testing.

Currently the program is configured to write the list to a file. It will make the file if it isn't there, it will overwrite if run in the same day, and create a new one each day. This is for comparison over time.
